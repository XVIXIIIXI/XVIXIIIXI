- Hi, I’m @XVIXIIIXI
- I’m interested in web development, both front-end and back-end, as well as expanding my knowledge in AI and deployment systems.
- I’m currently learning C++ to broaden my programming capabilities.
- I’m looking to collaborate on web projects, AI initiatives, and any exciting platforms that involve complex deployment.
- How to reach me: Feel free to contact me through GitHub or connect on Telegram @XVIXIIIXI.
- Fun fact: I have experience working on AI projects and RDP platform deployment—always looking to push the boundaries of what code can do!

I specialize in web development and can work with HTML, CSS, Java, and Python, and I'm constantly expanding my skill set. If you have an exciting project, let's connect!
